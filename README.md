# BST & Treap

Repo contains some of simple implementations of different data structures.

## Binary Search Tree

"In computer science, a binary search tree, also called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a rooted binary tree whose internal nodes each store a key greater than all the keys in the node's left subtree and less than those in its right subtree." -- Wikipedia

## Treap

"In computer science, the treap and the randomized binary search tree are two closely related forms of binary search tree data structures that maintain a dynamic set of ordered keys and allow binary searches among the keys" -- Wikipedia
